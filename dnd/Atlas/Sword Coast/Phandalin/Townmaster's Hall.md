This modest, two-story roadhouse has six rooms for rent on the upper floor. A bed for the night costs 5 sp, while a meal costs 1 sp. The proprietor is a short, friendly male human named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining.

If the characters talk to Toblen, he shares a brief tale told to him by one of his regular patrons. Roll a `d6` and consult the Phandalin Tales table to determine which tale Toblen knows, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.
