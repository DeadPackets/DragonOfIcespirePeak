### Story Introduction

1. Players will start resting at a campfire outside of [[Introduction | Phandalin]] with Merrim The Brave.
2. The characters can ask Merrim questions about Phandalin, the state of the land, and his personal life (make it up on the spot, he gon die lol)
3. As the DM, roll and if the roll is above the player's passive perception they will not notice the Orcs sneak on the party.
4. Do an insight check, anyone who passes will note that the Orcs look very starved and dirty - almost like they have been sleeping in the forest on the floor instead of their regular castle.
5. Make the encounter seem almost impossible to beat, with the party being ambushed by a dozen Orcs.
6. Merrim will always roll with the highest insight, and charge ahead towards the Orcs and make an attack.
7. Let the combat go for a few turns, avoid damaging the party.
8. Suddenly, the party will hear a loud screech. Merrim - the only character in the party who can understand Cryovain's words.
9. Merrim, terrified by Cryovain's words and power, will enter a state of psuedo insanity.
10. The party gets a good look at Cryovain. His size, his length, and most of all, the powerful roar that comes with him.
11. Cryovain will unleash a wind attack, needing a DEX saving throw to not fall over (and be reduced to 1 hit point).
12. Cryovain will then unleash his ice breath, freezing and instantly killing every single one of the orcs as well as Merrim.
13. Cryovain will stare the party down, and the battle will continue (Merrim will always miss, and the party will try their best to hit. If anyone hits Merrim, he will leave.)
14. The party will then notice Merrim has something shining under the ice, and will need to pass a:
	1. INT saving throw to figure out what it is
	2. STR saving throw to break the ice
	3. Cast any fire spell to melt the ice
15. Merrim has the following loot on him: [[plate-armor|Plate Armor]], [[greatsword|Greatsword]], 50 GP, 2 Potions of Healing, and the [[aid|Aid]] artifact (max uses of 3).
16. Merrim is also carrying a letter instructing him to head to Phandalin and seek out Harbin Wester for quests.


#### Merrim The Brave:

- A Dragonborn Paladin wearing heavy armor and carrying a sword emitting holy light.
- Merrim is a lawful good character with a strong focus on saving the world and maintaining peace.
- He has blue-greenish skin, with sharp blue eyes. He is 7ft tall and 250 lbs heavy.
- Merrim will tell the players about the Protectors of The Light, a guild that he is a member of.

The players will most likely then head to[[Introduction | Phandalin]]. If they long-rest, nothing will happen.


## Play Notes

1. All characters introduced themselves around the fire.
2. Merrim introduced himself to the players.
3. The dragon killed all the orcs and Merrim.
4. Everyone got knocked down to 1hp, and [[Mahmoud - Abu Al Futoo7 Babars]] dealt the blow that scared off the dragon.
5. The loot was shared equally amongst the players, with [[Imad - Iblees Ibn Iblees]] discovering that the artifact is an [[aid]] artifact with 3 uses left.
6. After a long rest and arriving at Phandalin, [[Mahmoud - Abu Al Futoo7 Babars]] slapped a child and dealt 3 damage, bruising him and slacking his jaw.
7. [[Mahmoud - Abu Al Futoo7 Babars]] learned that he can know more about who is seeking from the Inn.
8. [[Imad - Iblees Ibn Iblees]] was talking to an innkeeper when she was about to tell him the 2nd [[Phandalin Tales]]
