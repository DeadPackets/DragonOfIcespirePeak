### First Interaction: The Inn

Sathune will approach [[Imad - Iblees Ibn Iblees]] as he is talking to the women at the Inn (I know Imad he will do this) and she will act interested in him.

The special thing about Sathune is that she will have different hair color and style to each player, because she is casting [[disguise-self|Disguise Self]] on herself. Below are the features Sathune will have depending on the player:

* [[Imad - Iblees Ibn Iblees]] - White hair, twin tails
* [[Hassan - Abu Al Hassan Sabah]] - Dirty blonde, wolfcut
* [[Ahmed - Abu Uthman Al Ja7eth]] - Black hair, straight down
* [[Mahmoud - Abu Al Futoo7 Babars]] - Ginger, small afro
* Suhaib (if applicable) - Platinum Blonde, 1960s short cut

If any player points out the difference in hair, they must succeed an Intelligence saving throw of 20+ or cast [[detect-magic|Detect Magic]]. Otherwise, the DM will keep insisting that the players do not notice anything weird about hair color.

Sathune will then try to convince any player (primarily Imad) to come to her room for some private fun, free of charge. Since the player has failed the intelligence check, they will not detect that she is lying or has any malicious intent (this can change with some magic but just wing it).

### Sathune's Private Room

If a player agrees to go Sathune's room, the player will notice she has some slight wrinkles that they could swear did not exist before.

```
Note to the DM: Keep the other players in the Inn and let them get busy drinking and talking with the Innkeeper.
```

Sathune will intensely flirt with the player with her, commenting on their appearance and complimenting them. She will attempt to seduce the player. For each time the player seduces back, ask them to roll a constitution saving throw. Any roll above a 15 saves them from losing life force to Sathune.

If the player fails 3 saving throws:
* they begin to notice their strength fading - but find themselves unable to move or call for help.
* they will slowly lose 1hp every turn, needing a Intelligence saving throw above 15 to save themselves from dying.
* if the player reaches 1hp, they will simply pass out and Sathune will leave the room.
* if the player gets out of the charm, she will ask for mercy.

If the player succeeds 3 saving throws
* they notice more of Sathune's features start to change and their weakened strength but they can fight it back.
* the DM will ask to roll for initiative
* Sathune is currently weakened, and only has an AC of 8 (she is pretty much naked) and 15 HP. If she is damaged enough, she will surrender and ask for mercy.

### A Succubus' Curse

Sathune will appear to the party as an old hag with a glass eye, nearly full boils on her skin and face, and greasy green skin. She will try to convince the players that this is not her original look and that she has been cursed to look this way.

Sathune has a curse that makes her original form repugnant to the normal eye, so the party must ignore her natural beauty and treat her as if she is an ugly hag. Any player who attempts to resist this curse needs to pass a 10+ wisdom saving throw or else they take 1hp damage.

Succubi thrive off of intense positive emotion:
* Love
* Pride
* Lust

Sathune will explain that Abayda Gwynn cursed her to reduce her powers and make people disgusted from her regular form, so she cannot feed off of Love or Pride from people and must rely on Lust in the form of her disguises. But the curse prevents her from holding her disguise for long as it drains what little magical power she has left. She is effectively starving and will plead with you to get rid of the curse as you see fit.

The players will need to either slay, convince, or deactivate the spell from Abayda Gwynn at the windmill south of Phandalin. ([[14-umbrage-hill|Umbrage Hill]])

Sathune will reveal her true form, which is literally a build similar to that of an emo goth chick, with black makeup and black hair and heavy eyeliner. The reason for this look is that Sathune has found that harming men has been less enjoyable for her and she would rather live her life through intense emotions.

Sathune will thank you for your troubles, and will kiss the player who talked to her on the cheek. She will give them a magical scroll that allows her to be summoned should they need help. She will give each player 50sp for their trouble and say that this is all she has currently. All players gain an [[inspiration]] point.
