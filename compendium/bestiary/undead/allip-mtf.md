## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The allip can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions

***Maddening Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`4d6 + 3`) psychic damage.

***Whispers of Madness.*** The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 7 (`1d8 + 3`) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip's choice that the allip can see. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

***Howling Babble (Recharge 6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (`2d8 + 3`) psychic damage, and it is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned). Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
